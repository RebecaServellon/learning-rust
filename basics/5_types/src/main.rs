// Types
// Rust provides several mechanisms to change or define the type pf primitive and user defined types


// Suppress all warnings from casts which overflow
#![allow(overflowing_literals)]

// Aliasing
// NanoSecond, Inch, and U64 are new names for u64

    // Casting to unsigned types - u8, u16
    // If the value fits within the new type, it remains unchanged
    // If it doesn't fit, a modular operation adjusts the value to fit within the new typeÂ´s range
    println!("1000 as a u16 is {}", 1000 as u16); // Output 1000

    println!("1000 as a u8 is {}", 1000 as u8); // Output 232 (1000 % 256)

    // Casting to signed types - i8, i16

    // If it doesn't, it is adjusted considering the two's complement representation
    println!("128 as a i16 is {}", 128 as i16); // Output 128

    // Casting from floating point to integer
    // Uses a saturating cast, values outside the bounds are adjusted to the maximum or minimum value of the new type
    // NaN is cast to 0
